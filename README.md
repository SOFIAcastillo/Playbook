Hey! This is a playbook format. 

### Is this format helpful?

It isn't, unless you desire to **optimize your business vision, structure and operations.**

Yes, you've got your people, tools, processess, whatever... *but are they optimal?* 

A way to answer this question is to first map with whom and with what you're working with in the present. [Because](https://youtu.be/CvBfHwUxHIk?t=187) only by knowing what you currently count on will you be able to consider if there's a better way to function.

### How does this whole thing work? (yes, the universe)

You start off by mapping your people, projects, tools, in order to share this information in a transparent and friendly way for everyone in the team to see. 

Once you have the information, you can use it as you please! 

You can evaluate each file with your team.

You can use it as a database for your business. 

You can question if there's something that needs to be fixed.

You can sell the information for Bitcoins.

Anything!
