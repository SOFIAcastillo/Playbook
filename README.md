Hey! This is a playbook format. 

### Is this format helpful?

It isn't, unless you desire to **optimize your business vision, structure and operations.**

Yes, you've got your people, tools, processess, whatever... *but are they optimal?* 

In order to evaluate if you're working in the best way you can, you can start by centralizing and making visible the business infromation, for you and your team. But, Sofia, *why be aware of that sort of information?* Be-e-ecause only by knowing what you currently do and what you currently count on, you can consider if there's a better way to function. 

### How does it work?

map your people, projects, tools. In order to have provide transparent information for everyone in the team. 

Why do for you to map the elements, channels and interrelations of your company. This is a way of making the information available to the whole team, facilitating the flow of your work.
